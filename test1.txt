------------------
adding txt when I am in feature-login
any change here to be commited in feature-login
here I want to merge this branch
    with my main branch.
--------------------
Changes : 
Line1 => Base commit

Line2 => hotfix branch
Line3 => hotfix branch
------------------------
This is main edition 21-2-2026 10:47 am
some txt here before creating hotfix2

This is txt from hotfix2 10:50 am
I found txt from main here and I add on it
--------------------------------------------
This is main edition 21-2-2026 11:12
before hotfix3 creation 

After editin my hotf4 branch I returned and 
I am trying to make conflict "edit in main after edit in hotf4"
Now..There is changes in hotf4 and opposite to it there is changes on main.
This is not extra edition in the branch..No it is independent changes in hotf4.
So lets see what will happen
